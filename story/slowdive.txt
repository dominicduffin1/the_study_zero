This drama of life. And what do you want to do now that you are here? 
I might think of moving away, said Clara.
Moving where? There is no where you can move and get the feeling you are chasing. It is just not possible here, in this dimension that we inhabit, at least, retorted Xerxes-132.

Xerxes-132 revved up the engine for his ultr0n-stargazer21. Clara looked beyond the space.
I am not sure if I am ready to leave yet. 
Xerxes-132 stopped the engines and looked into the distance where Clara was looking. 
Let's leave tomorrow. One more day of misery on this planet won't harm much, Clara mused.
